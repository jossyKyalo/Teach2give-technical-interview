## Capitalize Words Program

### Description

This Python program takes a string, capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string, and returns the modified string. The program implements basic string manipulation by identifying each word in a string and applying the capitalization rule.

### Example

- **Input:** `"hi"`
  - **Output:** `"Hi"`

- **Input:** `"i love programming"`
  - **Output:** `"I Love Programming"`

## FAQ Accordion

### Description

This challenge focuses on frontend development, where the objective is to build a simple FAQ accordion component using HTML and CSS.

The **FAQ accordion** allows users to click on a question, which reveals its answer. When another question is clicked, the previous answer hides, demonstrating accordion functionality.

### Features

- **Accordion behavior**:  
  - When a user clicks on a question, its corresponding answer becomes visible.
  - Clicking a different question hides the previous answer and shows the new answer.
  
- **Responsive design**:  
  - On mobile devices, the questions and answers stack vertically to enhance accessibility.
  - On larger screens (tablets or desktops), the layout can display side by side for a better user experience.

### Requirements

- **Core Functionality**:
    - The accordion opens and closes smoothly on user interaction.
    - Only one question-answer pair is visible at a time (accordion behavior).
  
- **Design and Responsiveness**:
    - The FAQ accordion should be adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jossyKyalo/Teach2give-technical-interview 
    ```

2. **Navigate to your project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd Teach2give-technical-interview
    ```

3. For the FAQ accordion, no installation is required. You can view the HTML and CSS code directly in your browser.  
For the **Capitalize Words Program**, you will need **Python** installed to run the script.

## Usage

1. **Capitalize Words Program**:
    - To run the Python program that capitalizes each word in a string, run the following command:
      ```bash
      python  algorithmicthinkinganddatastructures.py
      ```
    - This will process your string and display the string with each word capitalized.

2. **FAQ Accordion**:
    - Open `FAQ.html` in any browser to view the FAQ accordion in action. No need for additional setup or dependencies.
